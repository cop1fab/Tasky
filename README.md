## Getting This project to work locally 

- Install `python3` or check your version of python using `python3 --version` 
- Install `pip3` with `brew install pip3` 
- Install the `virtualenv` : We use virtual env called `myenv` on this project to allow everyone to have all the 
   dependencies installed with the project instead of having them globally 
- Run `pip3 install flask flask-sqlalchemy` 

Once you have got all these dependencies installed, You are good to go. 

NB: This project is still ongoing, I intend to make it the ultimate todo application.
